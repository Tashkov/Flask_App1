This is a second iteration of the same app
The main problems with the first one were that i had the same instances of pip, flask and sqlalchemy installed on different directories on my PC
That is why i deleted everything, did a clean install of Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy and now everything seems to work just fine

There are some html templates with inheretance using jinja2 sintax
Also i built a functionning DB 

Entry 01.02.2021 
The main idea now is to switch the db from sqlite to postgresql. 
  - I have to find out how to do this.
  - I have to make a written plan before going forward with any coding
  - Write down all the possible ways it can go wrong
Important task:
  - Check how to do migration
