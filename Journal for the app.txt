This is a second iteration of the same app
The main problems with the first one were that i had the same instances of pip, flask and sqlalchemy installed on different directories on my PC
That is why i deleted everything, did a clean install of Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy and now everything seems to work just fine

There are some html templates with inheretance using jinja2 sintax
Also i built a functionning DB
